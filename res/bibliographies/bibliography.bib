We first identify the drivers of such software projects and identify different types of geographic information software, e.g. desktop GIS, remote sensing software, server GIS etc. We then list the major projects for each software category. Afterwards we discuss the points that should be considered if free and open source software is to be selected for use in business and research, such as software functionality, license types and their restrictions, developer and user community characteristics, etc. Finally possible future developments are addressed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Over the past few years the world of free and open source geospatial software has experienced some major changes. For instance, the website FreeGIS.org currently lists 330 GIS-related projects. Besides the advent of new software projects and the growth of established projects, a new organisation known as the OSGeo Foundation has been established to offer a point of contact. This paper will give an overview on existing free and open source desktop GIS projects. To further the understanding of the open source software development, we give a brief explanation of associated terms and introduce the two most established software license types: the General Public License (GPL) and the Lesser General Public License (LGPL). After laying out the organisational structures, we describe the different desktop GIS software projects in terms of their main characteristics. Two main tables summarise information on the projects and functionality of the currently available software versions. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of open source software, with an emphasis on research and teaching, are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

Over 1946-2009, countries with public debt/GDP ratios above 90{\%} averaged 2.2{\%} real annual GDP growth, not -0.1{\%} as published. The published results for (i) median GDP growth rates for the 1946-2009 period and (ii) mean and median GDP growth figures over 1790-2009 are all distorted by similar methodological errors, although the magnitudes of the distortions are somewhat smaller than with the mean figures for 1946-2009. Contrary to Reinhart and Rogoff's broader contentions, both mean and median GDP growth when public debt levels exceed 90{\%} of GDP are not dramatically different from when the public debt/GDP ratios are lower. The relationship between public debt and GDP growth varies significantly by period and country. Our overall evidence refutes RR's claim that public debt/GDP ratios above 90{\%} consistently reduce a country's GDP growth.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{NavarroCarrion2016,
abstract = {Land cover (LC) is a scientific landscape classification based on physical properties of earth materials. This information is usually retrieved through remote sensing techniques (e.g. forest cover, urban, clay content, among others). In contrast, Land use (LU) is defined from an anthropocentric point of view. It describes how a specific area is used (e.g. it is usual to indicate whether a territory supports an intensive, extensive use or it is unused). Both geospatial layers are essential inputs in many socio-economic and environmental studies. The INSPIRE directive provides technical data specifications for harmonization and sharing of voluminous LU/ LC datasets across all countries of the EU. The INSPIRE initiative proposes Object-Oriented Modelling as a data modelling methodology. However, the most used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are built upon relational databases. This may jeopardize LU/LC data usability, since GIS practitioners will eventually face the object-relational impedance mismatch. In this paper, the authors introduce the SIOSE database (Spanish Land Cover and Land Use Information System), which was the first implementation of an object-oriented land cover and Land-use datamodel, in line with the recommendation of the INSPIRE Directive, separating both themes. SIOSE data can be downloaded as relational database files, where information describing each single LU/LC object is divided among several related tables, so database queries can be complex and time consuming. The authors show these technical complexities through a computational experience, comparing SQL and NoSQL databases for querying spatial data downloaded from SIOSE. Finally, the authors conclude that NoSQL geoda- tabases deserve to be further explored because they could scale for LU/LC data, both horizontally and vertically, better than relational geodatabases, improving usability and making the most of the EU harmonization efforts.},

Though computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a `DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

In order to maximize the bioprospecting efficiency of natural products (NP), taxonomy, geography and biodiversity are starting to be used to draw conclusions on which taxonomic groups and/or regions may be of interest for future research. However, accurate taxonomic information and sampling location of source organisms have often been overlooked. Although these issues were already reported a few decades ago and improvements have been made, such outstanding problems are still recurrent in recent peer-reviewed literature. Here, we focus on the importance of taxonomic and geographic identification of source material and illustrate how taxonomic and geographic data of source organisms continues to be poorly handled. It is our opinion that this issue needs to be discussed within the NP community with the ultimate goal of improving publication standards and guaranteeing the scientific principle of research reproducibility. Moreover, by doing so, it will be possible to take advantage of information available in the literature to develop cross-disciplinary meta-analyses that may help to advance the state of the art of NP research and future bioprospecting endeavours.},

Previous suggestions to address this problem are unlikely to be effective. For example, a journal of negative results publishes otherwise unpublishable reports.

Unfortunately, for students who are preparing for a research career, this type of curriculum fails to address many of the day-to-day organizational challenges associated with performing computational experiments. In practice, the principles behind organizing and documenting computational experiments are often learned on the fly, and this learning is strongly influenced by personal predilections as well as by chance interactions with collaborators or colleagues. The purpose of this article is to describe one good strategy for carrying out computational experiments. I will not describe profound issues such as how to formulate hypotheses, design experiments, or draw conclusions. Rather, I will focus on relatively mundane issues such as organizing files and directories and documenting progress. These issues are important because poor organizational choices can lead to significantly slower research progress. I do not claim that the strategies I outline here are optimal. These are simply the principles and practices that I have developed over 12 years of bioinformatics research, augmented with various suggestions from other researchers with whom I have discussed these issues.},

abstract = {This paper traces the evolution of measures and parameters for the evaluation of science and scientific journals from the first attempts during the early part of the last century to the development of the most popular, current and widely used metrics viz., citations, impact factor (IF) etc. The identification of measures of evaluation in science and scientific reporting paralled the post-war increase in funding in the United States of America. Biomedical and medical sciences continue to garner a major share, estimated to be almost two-thirds of total research and development funding of over US{\$} 350 billion. There has been a concomitant growth in the publications in learned journals. About 1.4 million papers are published every year in an estimated 20,000 journals. In India there are an estimated 100 journals in medical sciences. With a steady increase of about 10{\%} every year, the competition for grants, awards, rewards etc., is fierce. This unrelenting increase in number of scientists and the resultant competition, the limitation of peer review was felt. A search was on for new quantifiable measures for informed decision making for funding, awards, rewards, etc. Now virtually all major decisions all over the world are based on some data linked to publications and/or citations. The concept of citations as tool for 'evaluating' science was first proposed by Eugene Garfield in 1955. The availability of Science Citation Index (SCI), Journal Citation Reports (JCR), Web of Science etc. and the relative ease with which they could be used (and abused) has spawned an entirely new area bibliometrics/scientometrics. As only a limited number of journals could be included in the Thomson Reuters (TR) databases (currently numbering about 10500), analyses based on such a limited dataset (also selected in a non-transparent way by the TR) has been widely and severely criticized by both the developed and developing countries. Yet, studies have shown that citation-based data and indicators (warts and all) could still be put to productive use for purposes of evaluation (as scientists just love numbers). There were simultaneous efforts to find alternative indicators using the TR databases, and through other innovative methods. Some of these include Google Scholar, PageRank, H-index, Y-factor, Faculty of 1000, Eigen Factor etc. The advantages and limitations of these indices are discussed. There is a need for a more critical look at these parameters from the Indian perspective to compute/ device/adapt these measures to suit our needs. There are 205 journals under the category Physiology and 201 in the Pharmacology category listed in the JCR. There are four major Indian journals under the category of Physiology and Pharmacology and none of them are listed in the TR databases reflecting the limitation of these databases. Eventually, and in the long run, the quality of our journals needs to be improved as the current era of globalization and web-access provides both a challenge and an oppportunity for the science and scientific journals published from India to get increased global visibility.},

@article{Liese2010,
abstract = {Despite interest in the built food environment, little is known about the validity of commonly used secondary data. The authors conducted a comprehensive field census identifying the locations of all food outlets using a handheld global positioning system in 8 counties in South Carolina (2008-2009). Secondary data were obtained from 2 commercial companies, Dun {\&} Bradstreet, Inc. (D{\&}B) (Short Hills, New Jersey) and InfoUSA, Inc. (Omaha, Nebraska), and the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC). Sensitivity, positive predictive value, and geospatial accuracy were compared. The field census identified 2,208 food outlets, significantly more than the DHEC (n = 1,694), InfoUSA (n = 1,657), or D{\&}B (n = 1,573). Sensitivities were moderate for DHEC (68{\%}) and InfoUSA (65{\%}) and fair for D{\&}B (55{\%}). Combining InfoUSA and D{\&}B data would have increased sensitivity to 78{\%}. Positive predictive values were very good for DHEC (89{\%}) and InfoUSA (86{\%}) and good for D{\&}B (78{\%}). Geospatial accuracy varied, depending on the scale: More than 80{\%} of outlets were geocoded to the correct US Census tract, but only 29{\%}-39{\%} were correctly allocated within 100 m. This study suggests that the validity of common data sources used to characterize the food environment is limited. The marked undercount of food outlets and the geospatial inaccuracies observed have the potential to introduce bias into studies evaluating the impact of the built food environment.},

abstract = {In scientific research, reproducibility and replicability are requirements to ensure the advancement of our body of knowledge. This holds true also for VGI-related research and studies. However, the characteristics of VGI suggest particular difficulties in ensuring reproducibility and replicability. In this article, we aim to examine the current situation in VGI-related research, and identify strategies to ensure realization of its full potential. To do so, we first investigate the different aspects of reproducibility and replicability and their impact on VGI-related research. These impacts are different depending on the objectives of the study. Therefore, we examine the study focus of VGI-related research to assess the current body of research and structure our assessment. This work is based on a rigorous review of the elements of reproducibility and a systematic mapping and analysis of 58 papers on the use of VGI in the crisis management field. Results of our investigation show that reproducibility issues related to data are a serious concern, while reproducibility issues related to analysis methods and processes face fewer challenges. However, since most studies still focus on analyzing the source data, reproducibility and replicability are still an unsolved problem in VGI-related research. Therefore, we show initiatives tackling the problem, and finally formulate strategies to improve the situation},

In that spirit, Nature this week presents related articles that take contradictory stances on what the banking system could, or indeed should, learn from ecologists. In a Perspective (see page 351), Andrew Haldane, executive director of financial stability at the Bank of England in London, and Robert May, a theoretical ecologist at the University of Oxford, UK, and former chief scientific adviser to the UK government, argue that the stability of complex networks of linked dependencies that make up the world's financial system can be tested using a simplified ecological model. They say that the results of their approach highlight ways in which economic policy could be changed to make the system more secure. Regulation of elements such as liquidity ratios, banking structures and trade in complex derivatives, they say, should work to protect the system rather than individual banks.},

In biomedical research, we are in the midst of a revolution with the generation of new data and scientific publications at a previously unprecedented rate. However, unfortunately, there is compelling evidence that the majority of these discoveries will not stand the test of time. To a large extent, this reproducibility crisis in basic and preclinical research may be as a result of failure to adhere to good scientific practice and the desperation to publish or perish. This is a multifaceted, multistakeholder problem. No single party is solely responsible, and no single solution will suffice. Here we review the reproducibility problems in basic and preclinical biomedical research, highlight some of the complexities, and discuss potential solutions that may help improve research quality and reproducibility.},

abstract = {Datasets collecting the ever-changing position of moving individuals are usually big and possess high spatial and temporal resolution to reveal activity patterns of individuals in greater detail. Information about human mobility, such as ‘when, where and why people travel', is contained in these datasets and is necessary for urban planning and public policy making. Nevertheless, how to segregate the users into groups with different movement and behaviours and generalise the patterns of groups are still challenging. To address this, this article develops a theoretical framework for uncovering space-time activity patterns from individual's movement trajectory data and segregating users into subgroups according to these patterns. In this framework, individuals' activities are modelled as their visits to spatio-temporal region of interests (ST-ROIs) by incorporating both the time and places the activities take place. An individual's behaviour is defined as his/her profile of time allocation on the ST-...},

@article{Meng2015a,
abstract = {Computational reproducibility depends on the ability to not only isolate necessary and sufficient computational artifacts but also to preserve those artifacts for later re-execution. Both isolation and preservation present challenges in large part due to the complexity of existing software and systems as well as the implicit dependencies, resource distribution, and shifting compatibility of systems that result over time-all of which conspire to break the reproducibility of an application. Sandboxing is a technique that has been used extensively in OS environments in order to isolate computational artifacts. Several tools were proposed recently that employ sandboxing as a mechanism to ensure reproducibility. However, none of these tools preserve the sandboxed application for re-distribution to a larger scientific community aspects that are equally crucial for ensuring reproducibility as sandboxing itself. In this paper, we describe a framework of combined sandboxing and preservation, which is not only efficient and invariant, but also practical for large-scale reproducibility. We present case studies of complex high-energy physics applications and show how the framework can be useful for sandboxing, preserving, and distributing applications. We report on the completeness, performance, and efficiency of the framework, and suggest possible standardization approaches.},
